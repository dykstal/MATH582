## Statistics Practicum (MATH 582)
### Overview
This repository stores the work completed independently by Aidan Dykstal during the Statistics Practicum at the Colorado School of Mines (Spring 2020).

### Roadmap
The software goals are:
 - Collect the Data and Aggregate it by Day in Python.
 - Perform Anomaly Detection on the Data.
 - Perform Relevance Estimation Given the Data.

Then, write a short report with some plots and examples (with a code appendix) displaying results.
